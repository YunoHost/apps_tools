EditorConfig is a widely supported specification to help maintain consistent coding styles:
https://editorconfig.org/#overview

It is meant to help the developer follow a unique code style for a few issues:

    - the indentation (4-spaces suggested here);
    - the encoding (utf-8 suggested);
    - remove trailing whitespaces;
    - ...

As a developer, you should check whether your editor [has native support](https://editorconfig.org/#pre-installed) or if it [requires a plugin](https://editorconfig.org/#download).

Feel free to customize it or to close the PR if you don't like it.
