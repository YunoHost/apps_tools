This is an ***automated*** patch to automatically use the new nodejs/ruby/go/composer resources from YunoHost 12.1

Please check https://doc.yunohost.org/packaging/manifest/resources/ for further documentation

In addition, this PR also removes empty `_common.sh` (if they only contain empty lines and comments)

Please bear in mind that this is just an **automated** patch and it may not work out of the box.
