# YunoHost Apps tools

This repository contains miscelaneous internal tools for YunoHost apps management.

If you're not familiar with YunoHost development, you're probably in the wrong place.
Maybe go to the [main YunoHost doc](https://doc.yunohost.org).

* autopatches: Scripts to automatically apply patches and create PRs on the apps
* autoupdate_app_sources: Daily task to find upstream updates for app packages
* readme_generator: Scripts that generate Readme files for the app git repositories
* update_app_levels: Hourly/weekly tasks to update the app catalog and [appstore](https://apps.yunohost.org)
* webhooks: miscenaleous webhooks for the app CI and readme generator.
